The goal of the game is to destroy all the jovians in the galaxy
The rules are more or less the same as the original game
You lose if
	You are critical for too long (power available is too low)
	Your total power goes to zero
	You are hit by a Antimatter explosion
	You Self Destruct

KNOWN ISSUES
	DEFLECTORS aren't updating when the Jovians zap your power (just in GUI not model)
	Error in thrown when the ship is exploded by an antimatter pod (didn't handle it, but the game ends anyway)
	New Game button not working properly (Unsure how to create new instance of singleton space object)
